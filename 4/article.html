<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    This is part 4 of a 
    <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/search.aspx?q=amazon+web+services+perdeck&x=0&y=0&sbo=kw" target="_blank">series of articles</a>
     about deploying your site to 
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS), 
    Amazon's counterpart to <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Windows Azure</a>.
</p>
<p>
    In parts 1, 2 and 3, you saw how to deploy a load balanced IIS based web site with a SQL Server database and its own domain name.

<p>
    Those parts showed how to do this using 
the AWS service
                <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/" target="_blank">Elastic Beanstalk</a>. 
    This allows you to define a configuration with EC2 servers, database server, etc. by completing a series of menus.
</p>
<p>
    This article introduces AWS 
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">CloudFormation</a>.
    This service too lets you create servers and deploy code. But instead of completing menus, you express your desired configuration
    in a text file called a template. 
</p>
<p>
    CloudFormation gives you much more control than Elastic Beanstalk, but there are many more details to get right - and many ways
    to get it wrong. I found that the learning curve can be quite steep.
</p>
<p>
    The downloads with this article contains a fully working and tested template to configure a load balanced web site with 
    an 
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/" target="_blank">RDS</a>
    based
    SQL Server
    database and a 
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/" target="_blank">Route 53</a>
    hosted zone for your domain name.
You might be able to use this template as a starting point for your own CloudFormation templates.
