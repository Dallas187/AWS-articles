<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    When it comes to hosting a web site, you have a couple of options.
    You could rent space on a web server from a hosting company. You could run your own servers.
    Or if you need to be able to quickly spin up/down servers in response to changing traffic,
    you could use a cloud provider.
</p>
<p>
In the .Net world, the best known cloud provider is 
    probably 
    <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Windows Azure</a>.
    However, it is far from the only one.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS)
    is a cloud provider, similar to 
 Azure. 
    Launched in 2006, it has a 4 year head start on Azure. 
    As of late 2014, it had 1.4 Million servers in data centres in the US, Europe, Asia and Australia.
    So it's very big.
</p>
<p>
    AWS offers over 40 services, from virtual machines and load balancers, to very large scale data warehouses.
    It's well documented and .Net receives first class support, making it a worthy alternative to Windows Azure.  
</p>
<p>
    In this series of articles, 
    we'll take a web site with a SQL Server database, and host it on AWS.
</p>
<p>
    To make it interesting, here are some goals:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>High Availability</b> -
        Even if an entire data centre fails, your site will recover automatically and keep going.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>High Performance</b> - 
        If marketing forgot to mention that massive ad campaign and your site suddenly receives massive traffic,
        it adjusts by automatically spinning up more web servers. When things quiet down, it automatically
        terminates them to save money.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Your Domain</b> - 
        If you have a spare domain lying around, we'll assign it to your site.
        Otherwise, we'll use an AWS sub domain.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Now please</b> -
        You should be done about an hour from now.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Here is what it will look like:
</p>
<a id="architecture"></a>
<img src="architecture.png" width="400" />
<p>
    We'll do the blue bit (the web servers and the load balancer) in this article.
    The DNS name servers (for your own domain name) and the database will be covered in 
    <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/search.aspx?q=amazon+web+services+perdeck&x=0&y=0&sbo=kw" target="_blank">subsequent articles</a>.
</p>

<a id="trialsite"></a><h2>Trial web site</h2>
<p>
    Seeing that this article shows how to deploy a web site to AWS,
    if you want to follow along you'll need some web site to deploy.
</p>
<p>
    If you have a web site project lying around, you can use that.
    MVC and WebForms are both fine.
</p>
<p>
    Otherwise feel free to 
    <a href="https://github.com/mperdeck/AWS-articles" target="_blank">get my trial site <i>SimpleSite</i> from Github</a>.
    This site does not use a database.
</p>
<p>

        Make sure that all references pointing to outside your web application have <i>Copy Local</i> set to 
        <i>True</i>. This way, they'll wind up in the 
        <a href="#sourcebundle">application source bundle</a>
        that you'll create in a moment to deploy your site to AWS.
    Otherwise, your site will simply crash when it starts up due to missing assemblies.
</p>
<p>
        This goes in particular for NuGet packages, because these normally sit in a 
        <i>packages</i> directory that sits outside your project directory. 
        Framework dlls should be fine, because the AWS EC2 web server will have the .Net framework installed.
        <p>
            <img src="copy-local.png" />
        </p>
</p>

<h2>Get an AWS account</h2>
<p>
    If you do not have an AWS account yet,
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/" target="_blank">create a free account</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Note that although Amazon calls this a &quot;free&quot; account,
    you may still incur some charges - if you go over usage limits, or if you use services
    that are not included in the free tier. For example, in this article we'll create a load balancer,
    which costs some tiny amount to run.
</p>

<h3>Costs</h3>
<p>
    Here are the pages with pricing info for the services that we'll use in this article, as of March 2015. 
You'll probably find that just playing around with these services won't cost you more than a coffee:
</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
        <th>
            Service

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Set a region</h2>
<p>
    AWS has data centers spread all over the world. They are divided into regions, such as &quot;US East (N. Virginia)&quot;
    and &quot;EU (Ireland)&quot;.
</p>


<p>
    After you've logged into the AWS Console, select the region that you're in or close to (top right hand corner of the page).
</p>
<p>
    Note that automatic failover for SQL Server databases
    is 
    <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SQLServer.html#SQLServer.Concepts.General.Mirroring" target="_blank">currently only available</a>
     in the US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and EU (Ireland) AWS regions.
    If automatic failover is important to you, than set one of these regions.
</p>

<a id="keypair"></a><h2>Create a Key Pair</h2>
<p>
    Once you have your EC2 web servers created, you will be able to log into them - using RDP, as with any other Windows Server machine.
    However, to keep your login password secure, AWS uses a 
    <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html" target="_blank">key pair</a>
     - the public key is used to encrypt the password, the private key is used
    to decrypt it. Only you have the private key. 
</p>
<p>
   The deployment system that we're going to set up will log into your web servers to 
    deploy your website, so it will need your key pair. That means that now is a good time to 
    <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair" target="_blank">create your key pair</a>:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Open the Amazon EC2 console: <i>Services</i> | <i>Compute</i> | <i>EC2</i> 
        <p>
            <img src="ec2-console.PNG" />
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Click Key Pairs in the navigation pane
        <p>
            <img src="key-pairs-menu-item.PNG" />
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Click the <i>Create Key Pair</i> button and follow the instructions.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Note that a key pair is only valid in the region where it was created. So when you create EC2 web servers in another region, you'll 
    need to create another key pair for that region to be able to log into the servers in that region. It's easiest to stick with one region.
</p>

<a id="sourcebundle"></a><h2>Application Source Bundle</h2>
<p>
    In order to deploy your web application to AWS, you have to 
    package it into an
    <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.deployment.source.html" target="_blank">application source bundle</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I have found that Amazon's instructions didn't give me 
    an application source bundle that would actually work on AWS.
</p>
<p>
    However, you can simply run msbuild to create a
valid application source bundle for you, using these command line instructions:
</p>
<pre>cd /D "&lt;directory with your .csproj file&gt;"
msbuild &lt;your project&gt;.csproj /t:Package /p:Configuration=Release /p:PackageLocation=. /p:AutoParameterizationWebConfigConnectionStrings=False
</pre>
<p>
    This produces a .zip file in the current directory. That .zip file is your application source bundle.
</p>


<h2>Creating the web servers and load balancer</h2>
<p>
    A very easy way to do this is through the 
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/" target="_blank">Elastic Beanstalk</a>
    service. 
    This lets you create a specification of the environment you want - what size web servers, what sort of database, etc.
    You also give it the code making up your web application.
    Once that's done, it creates all the web servers, etc. you specified and deploys your application.
</p>
<p>
    A specification is called a &quot;Elastic Beanstalk application&quot;.
    You can have multiple Elastic Beanstalk applications - which may be useful for example if you have multiple web sites. 
</p>
<p>
    When it comes time to deploy a new version of your application, you select the Elastic Beanstalk
    and tell it to deploy your new version. 
</p>
<p>
Because it stores each version, you can quickly get a list of versions that have gone before, and revert to a previous version
    if your new version doesn't work out.
    This puts it in the same space as 
    for example
    <a href="https://octopusdeploy.com/" target="_blank">Octopus Deploy</a>.
</p>

<h3>Creating an Elastic Beanstalk application</h3>

<ol>
    <li>
        Open the Elastic Beanstalk console: <i>Services</i> | <i>Deployment &amp; Management</i> | <i>Elastic Beanstalk</i> 
        <p>
            <img src="ebs-console.PNG" />
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Click <i>Create New Application</i> (top right corner of the page).
        AWS now takes you through a wizard to gather all your specifications.
        <p />
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Application Info</b> -
        Give your application some fancy name. Or maybe something boring, such as &quot;application1&quot;. Click <i>Next</i>.
        <p />
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>New Environment</b> -
        Elastic Beanstalk lets you create two types of applications - web sites and 
        <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features-managing-env-tiers.html" target="_blank">workers</a>
         that take items from a 
        <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" target="_blank">queue</a>
        and process them.  
        <p>
            Here we're deploying a web site, so click <i>Create web server</i>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Permissions</b> -
        Your new environment needs certain permissions, which are contained in an
        <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html" target="_blank">IAM instance profile</a>.
        Just click <i>Next</i> to accept the default.
        <p />
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Environment Type</b> -
        Assuming you are deploying a .Net application, set <i>Predefined configuration</i> to <i>IIS</i>. 
        And set <i>Environment type</i> to <i>Load balancing, auto scaling</i>. Click <i>Next</i>.
        <p />
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Application Version</b> -
        Here is where you get to upload your application, so it can be deployed to the web servers. Select
        <i>Upload your own</i> and choose the application source bundle that you created
        <a href="#sourcebundle">earlier</a>.
        <p>
            Later on, you'll see how to deploy new versions of your application to an existing environment.
            The <i>Deployment Limits</i> section shows how Elastic Beanstalk avoids downtime during a deployment
            by deploying to a few web servers at a time, while the others keep serving requests. Click <i>Next</i>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Environment Information</b> -
        Elastic Beanstalk lets you have multiple 
        <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.environments.html" target="_blank">environments</a>
         for your application, such as a Test environment, a Live environment, etc.
        <p>
        Each environment (test site, live site, etc.) obviously has its own URL. Here you get to specify 
            a sub domain of the <i>elasticbeanstalk.com</i> domain. 
            <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/search.aspx?q=amazon+web+services+perdeck&x=0&y=0&sbo=kw" target="_blank">Later on</a>, 
            you'll see how to associate your own domain 
            with your site.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Additional Resources</b> -
        For now, we're creating a web site without a database. So leave all checkboxes unchecked. 
        <p />
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Configuration Details</b> -
        You can use the defaults for most fields. However, these fields are noteworthy:

                        The load balancer keeps track of the health of your web servers, so it can replace web servers
                        that are no longer healthy. It does this by regularly sending requests to each web server.
                        If it gets a normal HTTP 200 response, it assumes the web server is healthy.
                        <p>
                        Here you specify the relative URL that the load balancer should request.

<h2>Deploy new version</h2>
<p>
To deploy a new version of your web site, first
        <a href="#sourcebundle">create a new application source bundle</a>.
        Then click <i>Upload and Deploy</i> on the Elastic Beanstalk dashboard.
</p>


<h2>Get some stats</h2>
<p>
    To get basic stats about your web site, on the Elastic Beanstalk dashboard, click <i>Monitoring</i>.
</p>
<p>
    You can change the 
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" target="_blank">metrics</a>
    on the dashboard via the <i>Edit</i> buttons.
</p>


<h2>Take down your servers to save money</h2>

<p>
    Once you're done with the servers, 
    you will want to take them down to save money.
</p>
<p>
    Note that one way of doing this would be by terminating the environment from the <i>Actions</i> drop down on the
    Elastic Beanstalk dashboard. However, this deletes your entire environment, so next time you want to spin up the servers,
    you have to go through the wizard again to specify the environment.
</p>
<p>
    The only way to take down your web servers is one by one:
    <i>Services</i> | <i>EC2</i> | <i>Instances</i> | click your server | <i>Actions</i> | <i>Instance State</i> | <i>Stop</i>.
</p>
<p>
    To take down your load balancer:
    <i>Load Balancers</i> (left hand menu) | click load balancer | <i>Actions</i> | <i>Delete</i>.
</p>

<p>
    Once all this is done, your Elastic Beanstalk application shows red.
</p>

<h2>Restart your environment</h2>

<p>
    To get your application operational again:
    <i>Services</i> | <i>Elastic Beanstalk</i> | click the environment | <i>Actions</i> | <i>Rebuild Environment</i>
</p>

<h2>Next Parts</h2>

<p>
    In 
    <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/search.aspx?q=amazon+web+services+perdeck&x=0&y=0&sbo=kw">subsequent parts</a>,
    you'll see how to add a SQL Server database with automatic fail over, 
    so if your database server goes missing, your application recovers automatically. You'll also see 
    how to point your own domain to your AWS hosted web site.
