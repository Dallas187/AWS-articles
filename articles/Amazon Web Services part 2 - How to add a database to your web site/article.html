<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    This is part 2 of a series of articles about deploying your site to 
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS), 
    Amazon's counterpart to <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Windows Azure</a>.
</p>
<p>
    In <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/search.aspx?q=amazon+web+services+perdeck&x=0&y=0&sbo=kw" target="_blank">part 1</a>,
    we looked at the architecture of a web site with load balanced web servers and a SQL Server database with automatic fail over.
    We then implemented a simple site without a database. In this part, we'll add the database. That is, we'll do the green bit below.
    The red bit (DNS name servers so your site uses your own domain) we'll leave for 
    <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/search.aspx?q=amazon+web+services+perdeck&x=0&y=0&sbo=kw" target="_blank">another part</a>.
</p>
<a id="architecture"></a>

<p>
    This article assumes you have a web site deployed to AWS with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/" target="_blank">Elastic Beanstalk application</a>, 
    as described in
    <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/search.aspx?q=amazon+web+services+perdeck&x=0&y=0&sbo=kw" target="_blank">part 1</a>.
    We'll first create the database, and then 
    <a href="#sitewithdb">deploy a new version of the web site</a>
     that uses that database.
</p>

<h2>Automatic fail over aka Multi-AZ deployment</h2>
<p>
    AWS refers to the automatic fail over feature as a 
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/multi-az/" target="_blank">Multi-AZ deployment</a>.
AZ stands for Availability Zone. Each AZ has its own data centre.
</p>
<p>
    With a Multi-AZ deployment, AWS creates a backup database server in another availability zone within the same region.
    Modifications to your main database server are continuously mirrored to the other server. If your main database server goes down,
    the other server is automatically made the main server (fail over). Because it has the same
    DNS name as the main database, your application doesn't need a new connection string.
</p>
<p>
    The fail over process may take a few minutes. During that time, your application will see a broken database connection.
    AWS will automatically spin up a new backup database server.
</p>
<p>
    Because the backup server is in another data centre, it is highly unlikely that both your main and backup servers 
    go down at the same time. Because they are in the same region, moving data from main to backup is still fast.
</p>
<p>
    Note that automatic failover for SQL Server databases
    is 
    <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SQLServer.html#SQLServer.Concepts.General.Mirroring" target="_blank">currently only available</a>
     in the US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and EU (Ireland) AWS regions.
</p>


<h2>Database with fail over costs money</h2>
<p>
    If you are using the
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/" target="_blank">AWS Free Tier</a>,
    you can use a database server running SQL Server Express for 
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/free/" target="_blank">free</a>
     (as of March 2015).
</p>
<p>
    The problem is that Amazon have implemented fail over for SQL Server servers using
    the SQL Server Mirroring feature. This feature is 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645993.aspx" target="_blank">not available</a>
     on SQL Server Express.
</p>
<p>
    Your cheapest option that supports mirroring would be a SQL Server Standard Edition database
    on a db.m1.small instance
    (<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/previous-generation/" target="_blank">pricing</a>).
</p>
<p>
    Because of this, I've discussed installation of both SQL Server Express (no fail over)
    and 
    <a href="#create-se">SQL Server Standard Edition</a>
     (with fail over, costs money) below.

<h2>Adding a database while creating a Elastic Beanstalk application</h2>
<p>
    In part 1, while going through the wizard to create the web servers and load balancer,
    there was a step <i>Additional Resources</i>
    where the wizard offered to create a database.
</p>
<p>
    It would certainly have been possible to create a database at that point in time.
    The wizard will ask you your username, password, database instance, etc., and even whether you want a 
    Multi-AZ Deployment. 
</p>
<p>
    However, if you say yes to that, Elastic Beanstalk throws an error when it actually tries to
    create the application. This is because a Multi-AZ Deployment for SQL Server requires that 
    an 
    <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.html" target="_blank">option group </a>
    is created and attached to the SQL Server database server that switches on mirroring.
    Elastic Beanstalk fails to do this though. As a result of this bug, it is easier to create the database
    directly from the RDS dashboard.
</p>
<p>
    Note that if you created a SQL Server Standard Edition database server with Multi-AZ Deployment,
    you can see its option group: <i>Services</i> | <i>RDS</i> | <i>Instances</i> | click your database (database details appear) | 
    click option group in the details section. 
</p>

<a id="dbservername"></a><h2>Find the database server name</h2>
<p>
    When you create a connection string for your new database server,
    you need to know the server name.
</p>
<p>
    That name is listed on the RDS dashboard as the end point:
</p>
<img src="db-server-name.png" />

<h2>Copy your current schema and data to your new database</h2>

<p>
As an aside, there is nothing stopping you from accessing your new database on AWS from SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). Simply create a new connection with the 
    <a href="#dbservername">database name you found earlier</a> and the username and password you specified whilst creating the new database.
</p>
<p>
My trial site <i>SimpleSiteWithDb</i> 
    (on 
        <a href="https://github.com/mperdeck/AWS-articles" target="_blank">Github</a>)
    uses
        <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/ee712907" target="_blank">Entity Framework Code First</a>,
    which means that it creates the database schema when it first runs against an empty server.
</p>
<p>
    However, if your application doesn't use
    Entity Framework Code First,
    you will want to copy the schema of your existing database to your new AWS database.
</p>
<p>
You can easily do this with SQL Database Migration Wizard, a tool that ironically was created inside Microsoft to transfer databases to Microsoft Azure.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <a href="http://sqlazuremw.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Download SQL Database Migration Wizard</a>. This gives you a .zip file.
    </li>
    <li>
        Expand the .zip file. The result will contain a file <i>SQLAzureMW.exe</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Run <i>SQLAzureMW.exe</i>. A wizard appears.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Select Process</b> -
        Set <i>Analyze / Migrate</i> to <i>Database</i>. Set <i>Target Server</i> to <i>SQL Server</i>. Leave everything else unchecked. Click <i>Next</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Connect to Server dialog</b> - Enter the details of the source database.
    </li>
    <li>
        Going through the wizard, it will let you save a script that creates the schema. You could use SSMS to  use that, but if you click <i>Next</i>, it will 
        apply the script for you.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Setup Target Server Connection - Connect to Server dialog</b> - Enter the details of your new database at AWS. Leave <i>Database</i> at <i>Master DB</i>. 
        Click <i>Connect</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
           <b>Setup Target Server Connection</b>
        -
        click your target database. Click <i>Create Database</i>. It now transfers the schema. Click <i>Exit</i>.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Once that's done, you can use the <i>SQL Server Import and Export Wizard</i>
    to copy your data from your current database to your new AWS database: 
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Open SQL Server Management Studio;
    </li>
    <li>
Connect to your current server;
    </li>
    <li>
        Right click your current database | <i>Tasks</i> | <i>Export Data</i>.
    </li>
</ol>


<a id="sitewithdb"></a><h2>Trial site that uses the database</h2>

<p>
    If you have a web site project lying around that uses a SQL Server database, you can use that.
    MVC and WebForms are both fine.
</p>
<p>
    Otherwise feel free to 
    get my trial site <i>SimpleSiteWithDb</i> from
    <a href="https://github.com/mperdeck/AWS-articles" target="_blank">Github</a>.
    If you use this site, do this <b>before</b> running it on your computer: 
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Make sure you have access to a SQL Server database server.
        If you don't, install 
        <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/server-cloud/products/sql-server-editions/sql-server-express.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Server Express</a> for free.
    </li>
    <li>
        Edit the connection string in the web.config file, so it points at your database server.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    If you use your own site, 
make sure that all references pointing to outside your web application have <i>Copy Local</i> set to 
        <i>True</i> (I've already done this for my trial site). This goes in particular for NuGet packages, because these normally sit in a 
        <i>packages</i> directory that sits outside your project directory. 
        Framework dlls should be fine, because the AWS EC2 web server will have the .Net framework installed.
</p>
            <img src="copy-local.png" />

<p>
    Lastly, make sure that the Release version of your site has a connection string pointing at the AWS database server, not your local database server.
</p>
<p>
    You can make this happen 
    through 
    <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/deployment/visual-studio-web-deployment/web-config-transformations" target="_blank">Web.config transformations</a>,
    by adding a <i>Web.Release.config</i> file in the same directory as your <i>Web.config</i> file.
The
    <i>Web.Release.config</i> file
    contains XSLT to transform the <i>Web.config</i> file to the Release version.
</p>
<p>
    My trial site already has such a file. Be sure to modify it, to give it your own database name, username and password.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, this     <i>Web.Release.config</i> file
would do the trick:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;configuration xmlns:xdt="http://schemas.microsoft.com/XML-Document-Transform"&gt;
    &lt;connectionStrings&gt;
      &lt;add name="&lt;connection string name used in web.config&gt;" 
        connectionString="Data Source=........rds.amazonaws.com;Initial Catalog=....;User Id=.....;
Password=.......;" 
        xdt:Transform="SetAttributes" xdt:Locator="Match(name)"/&gt;
    &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;
 
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre>

<p>
    Don't forget to fill in your server name, username and password.
</p>
<p>
    Some connection strings use <i>Integrated Security=SSPI;</i>. Do not use this. It will cause AWS to try to log into your database with the 
    <i>NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON</i> account rather than your own account - which will fail.
