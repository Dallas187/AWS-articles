<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS)
    is a cloud provider, similar to 
    <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Windows Azure</a>. 
    Launched in 2006, it has a 4 year head start on Azure. 
    As of late 2014, it had 1.4 Million servers in data centres in the US, Europe, Asia and Australia.
    So it's very big.
</p>
<p>
    AWS offers over 40 services, from virtual machines and load balancers, to very large scale data warehouses.
    It's well documented and .Net receives first class support, making it a worthy alternative to Windows Azure.  
</p>
<p>
    In this article, 
    we'll take a web site with a SQL Server database, and host it on AWS.
</p>
<p>
    To make it interesting, here are some goals:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Highly Availability</b> -
        Even if an entire data centre fails, your site will recover automatically.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>High Performance</b> - 
        If marketing forgot to mention that massive ad campaign and your site suddenly receives massive traffic,
        it adjusts by automatically spinning up more web servers. When things quiet down, it automatically
        terminates them to save money.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Your Domain</b> - 
        If you have a spare domain lying around, we'll assign it to your site.
        Otherwise, we'll use an AWS sub domain.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Now please</b> -
        You should be done about an hour from now.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Here is what it will look like:
