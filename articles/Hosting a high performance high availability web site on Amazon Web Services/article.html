<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS)
    is a cloud provider, similar to 
    <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Windows Azure</a>. 
    Launched in 2006, it has a 4 year head start on Azure. 
    As of late 2014, it had 1.4 Million servers in data centres in the US, Europe, Asia and Australia.
    So it's very big.
</p>
<p>
    AWS offers over 40 services, from virtual machines and load balancers, to very large scale data warehouses.
    It's well documented and .Net receives first class support, making it a worthy alternative to Windows Azure.  
</p>
<p>
    In this article, 
    we'll take a web site with a SQL Server database, and host it on AWS.
</p>
<p>
    To make it interesting, here are some goals:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Highly Availability</b> -
        Even if an entire data centre fails, your site will recover automatically.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>High Performance</b> - 
        If marketing forgot to mention that massive ad campaign and your site suddenly receives massive traffic,
        it adjusts by automatically spinning up more web servers. When things quiet down, it automatically
        terminates them to save money.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Your Domain</b> - 
        If you have a spare domain lying around, we'll assign it to your site.
        Otherwise, we'll use an AWS sub domain.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Now please</b> -
        You should be done about an hour from now.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Here is what it will look like:

<h2>Trial web site</h2>
<p>
    Seeing that this article shows how to deploy a web site to AWS,
    if you want to follow along you'll need some web site to deploy.
</p>
<p>
    If you have a web site project lying around that use a SQL Server database, you can use that.
    MVC and WebForms are both fine.
</p>
<p>
    Otherwise feel free to 
    <a href="https://github.com/mperdeck/AWS-articles" target="_blank">get my trial site SimpleSiteWithDb from Github</a>.
    If you use this site, do this <b>before</b> running it on your computer: 
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Make sure you have access to a SQL Server database server.
        If you don't, install 
        <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/server-cloud/products/sql-server-editions/sql-server-express.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Server Express</a> for free.
    </li>
    <li>
        Edit the connection string in the web.config file, so it points at your database server.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create an empty database named <i>BookStore</i> on the server (as named as the <i>Initial Catalog</i>in the connection string).
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    My trial site uses 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/ee712907" target="_blank">Entity Framework Code First</a>. 
    This way, it creates everything that it needs in the 
    <i>BookStore</i> database when it starts up for the first time - so you don't have to do this yourself.
    However, you can deploy any site to AWS, it doesn't have to use Entity Framework Code First.
